                <p>At this point you are probally wondering, why? <br>
                    And that's a complety valid question, I never expected everyone to see appeal in this.
                    However if I can make at least one group happy, I'll count that as a win.
                    <br> <br>
                    The app and the games were also build with mobile first mindset, which makes them work smoothly on almost every device.
                    I also spent a lot of time creating an user interface that is as easy to use as it is to look at.
