                <h2>Bored while drinking? <br><span>Give us a chance!</span></h2>
                <p>Buragemu is a multipurpose app made for people who are often bored while drinking.
                    It offers you what many failed to deliver, an adless experience while still looking as modern as possible.
                    The app is build in React.js, since that's my javascript library of choice. Currently it offers 4 games (the number isn't the last): <br>
                    - Quiplash <br>
                    - Would you rather <br>
                    - Truth or shoots <br>
                    - Powerhour (for extreme drinking) <br>
                    All those games were build from scrath optimized to look and function as smoothly as possible.
